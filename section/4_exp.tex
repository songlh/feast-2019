\section{Experiment}

\subsection{Methodology}


\noindent\textbf{Implementation and Platform} 
We implement \Tool{} using LLVM-7.0.0~\cite{LLVM}, 
and conduct our experiments on a Linux machine, 
with E5-2630 CPU, 32GB memory and 3.10 kernel. 

\noindent\textbf{Benchmarks}
\Tool{} is a tool to automatically identify loops that implement FSMs. 
We evaluate \Tool{} using representative software in the real world. 
Our selected software come from three sources. 

a. Two ctf programs

b. cgc programs 

c. OpenVPN

\noindent\textbf{Evaluation Setting}


We mainly compute metrics to answer two research questions regarding the coverage and accuracy of \Tool{}.

\textbf{Q1.} Whether \Tool{} can identify all FSM implementations in evaluated software?
 
\textbf{Q2.} Whether \Tool{} will report loops, which are not to implement FSMs, 
generating false positives.
