Finite state machine (FSM) is a type of computation models widely
used in various software programs.
Extracting implemented FSMs has many important applications in the
networking, software engineering and security domains.
In this paper, we first conduct an empirical study to understand 
how FSMs are implemented in real-world software.
Under the guidance of our study results, we then design a static analysis tool, 
\Tool{}, to automatically identify and synthesize implemented FSMs.
Evaluation using 160 software programs from three sources shows that
\Tool{} can extract all implemented FSMs 
and report very few false positives.
