Finite state machine (FSM) is a type of computation models widely
used in various software programs.
Extracting implemented FSMs has many important applications in the
networking, software engineering and security domains.
In this paper, we first study how FSMs are implemented in real-world software.
We then design a static analysis tool, \Tool{}, to identify and synthesize
implemented FSMs.
Evaluation using 160 software programs shows that
\Tool{} can extract FSMs with good coverage and accuracy.
