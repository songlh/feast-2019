Finite state machine (FSM) is a computation model widely 
used in various software programs. 
Extracting implemented FSMs has many important applications in 
network, software engineering and security. 
In this paper, we first study how FSMs are implemented in the real world.
We then design a static analysis tool, \Tool{}, to identify and synthesize 
implemented FSMs in a program. 
Evaluation using 160 software programs show that 
\Tool{} can extract FSMs with good coverage and accuracy.
