\noindent\textbf{Program analysis to extract models.} A set of work also applies various program analysis techniques 
to extract certain composing elements in programs: for example, NFactor~\cite{wu2016automatic} 
uses symbolic execution and program slicing to extract match-action tables in NF programs; 
StateAlyzr~\cite{khalid2016paving} extracts state abstractions. 
While \Tool{} extract FSMs, which is a more concise and expressive model.

\noindent\textbf{Blackbox modeling.} Another approach to get the FSM of a program is blackbox modeling. 
L* algorithm~\cite{angluin1987learning} by Angluin is the theoretical foundation, 
and it is applied in various scenarios (e.g., NF modeling~\cite{moon2019alembic}, 
protocol analysis~\cite{cho2011mace}). Compared with \Tool{}, 
the completeness and soundness of the blackbox approach are limited --- 
it is not possible to enumerate all inputs for blackbox testing (e.g., the input of infinite length).
