\noindent\textbf{Program analysis to extract models.} 
A set of work also applies various program analysis techniques 
to extract certain models implemented in programs: 
for example, NFactor~\cite{wu2016automatic} 
uses symbolic execution and program slicing to extract match-action 
tables in NF programs; 
StateAlyzr~\cite{khalid2016paving} extracts state abstractions 
from implementations of stateful protocols. 
Different from existing techniques, \Tool{} extracts FSMs, 
which are more concise and expressive.

\noindent\textbf{Blackbox modeling.} 
Another approach to get the FSM of a program is blackbox modeling. 
L* algorithm invented by~\citet{angluin1987learning} 
is the theoretical foundation.
It executes a program with different inputs and 
synthesizes the FSM by observing outputs.  
L* algorithm is applied in various scenarios 
(e.g., NF modeling~\cite{moon2019alembic}, 
protocol analysis~\cite{cho2011mace}). 
Compared with \Tool{}, blackbox approaches suffer from two limitations. 
First, they model the whole program as one single FSM in a coarse granularity, 
while it is possible that there are multiple FSMs implemented in a program. 
Second, their completeness and soundness are limited --- 
it is not possible to enumerate all inputs for 
FSM inference (e.g., an input of infinite length).
