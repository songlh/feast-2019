\section{Applications}

\Tool{} is a tool that can automatically extract implemented FSMs in a program. 
In this section, we will discuss how the extracted FSMs can facilitate 
various network and security practices.  


\noindent\textbf{Network Verification.}

\noindent\textbf{Code Debloating.}
Code bloat refers to code in unnecessarily large size~\cite{code-bloat}.
It widely exists in production-run software~\cite{code-bloat-study}. 
If untackled, bloated code can introduce more bugs and vulnerabilities, 
lowering the security~\cite{protocol-mao}, 
and conduct resultless or redundant computation, 
degrading the performance~\cite{BloatFSE2008,XuBloatPLDI2009,XuBloatPLDI2010}. 

Many techniques have been proposed to address the code bloating problem. 
They either remove temporary object copies~\cite{BloatFSE2008,XuBloatPLDI2009,
XuBloatPLDI2010,Reusable,Cachetor} 
or eliminate functions unreached from 
\texttt{main}~\cite{container-debloating-1, 
container-debloating-2, dinghao-1}. 
None of them try to change the underlying program models.
With extracted FSMs from \Tool{}, researchers can consider 
further code debloating can be conducted through
eliminating unnecessary program logics. 
For example, given the extracted FSM in Figure~\ref{fig:cgc}, 
developers may consider removing state \texttt{open\_double} and 
state \texttt{close\_double}. 
A tool can take the FSM from \Tool{} as input and automatically 
remove code pertaining to the two states. 
The tool can test or validate whether the changed program is correct 
by launching testing, while monitoring the control flow 
inside the FSM loop and the value of the state variable \texttt{state}.
